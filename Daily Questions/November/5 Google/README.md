## Question

`You are given a set of synonyms, such as (big, large) and (eat, consume). Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.`

`For example, the following two sentences are equivalent:`

    "He wants to eat food."
    "He wants to consume food."
    Note that the synonyms (a, b) and (a, c) do not necessarily imply (b, c): consider the case of (coach, bus) and (coach, teacher).

`Follow-up: what if we can assume that (a, b) and (a, c) do in fact imply (b, c)?`
