## Question

`Youâ€™re tracking stock price at a given instance of time. Implement an API with the following functions: add(), update(), remove(), which adds/updates/removes a datapoint for the stock price you are tracking. The data is given as (timestamp, price), where timestamp is specified in unix epoch time.`

`Also, provide max(), min(), and average() functions that give the max/min/average of all values seen thus far.`
