## Question

`You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.`

`For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of 'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.`

`Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be 357.`
