## Question

`The 24 game is played as follows. You are given a list of four integers, each between 1 and 9, in a fixed order. By placing the operators +, -, *, and / between the numbers, and grouping them with parentheses, determine whether it is possible to reach the value 24.`

`For example, given the input [5, 2, 7, 8], you should return True, since (5 * 2 - 7) * 8 = 24.`

`Write a function that plays the 24 game.`
